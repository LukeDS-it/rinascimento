<h2>Directory initialisation</h2>
<p>
    The installer will now try to initialise the main directory for this guest.<br />
    If you have configured the base directory properly, giving the application server the right
    read/write permissions, this will end correctly. In case of errors, check that the application
    server where Rinascimento is published has full read/write access to the root base directory.
